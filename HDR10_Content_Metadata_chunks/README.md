### Run HDR10_Content_Metadata in 4 chunks simultaneously

###### Steps to follow:

1. Keep settings.avs, chunk1.avs, chunk2.avs, chunk3.avs, chunk4.avs, final_step.avs and run.bat together (whatever location you prefer).
2. Open settings.avs, and change the relevant settings.
3. Download [avsr64](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=173259) if you don't have it.<br>
Place avsr64.exe next to the files from `1.` or add it to the system path.
4. Run run.bat.
